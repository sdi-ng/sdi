SDI - An Instant Diagnose System (draft) 
================================

This is a PoC (Proof of Concept) version of a way to write a simple and
scalable system to Diagnose Instantly a huge (and small) networks.

We provide a way to run HOURLY scripts on the remote host and store them on
the LOCAL host, also there's a simple way to generate some WEB pages
containing all important stuff to show (Processor type, RAM, RAID
Status...). 

Goals
~~~~~

Our goals are mainly:
- Write a simple and scalable diagnose system
- Simple CODE (write in some scriptable languange as much as possible)
 + Our code is written all in BASH today
- Simple API to collect data, so the creator of the script should not know
  how to generate HTMLs and any other stuff, just GIVE information.

Contact
~~~~~~~

If you have any doubt about SDI way of work you can simply ask us and read
all the code 8^)

You can send an email to contato@c3sl.ufpr.br or to some developer. Our DEV
and USER mailing list are yet to be created.

Notes
~~~~~

- Some scripts provided here are exclusively to our testing network PrD
  (Parana Digital www.c3sl.ufpr.br/prd)
- This version Is only a Proof of Concept, a new and more functional version
  is comming.
