## Goals

Our goals are mainly:
- Write a simple and scalable diagnose system
- Simple CODE (write in some scriptable languange as much as possible)
 + Our code is written all in BASH today
- Simple API to collect data, so the creator of the script should not know
  how to generate HTMLs and any other stuff, just GIVE information.
