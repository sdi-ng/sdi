1. INTRODUCTION
===============

First, it's important to understand how SDI works to get through this
README. To help with that, please check the SDI README file.

And here comes the first question: why do you use a web interface with
SDI? Simple question.

We need to see the hosts last data in a simple way, not checking big log
files or access a database. The simple way we found was to show the
information based on tables, where all you need is there.

With this format we can add new features and interface elements very
easily. Sorting scripts, auto-update and color cells are some examples
of what you'll see when finish configuring your SDI.

So, let's start.


2. SDI CONCEPTS
===============

At this time, you must known what is CLASS and HOST inside SDI. This is
essential to put SDI run.

A HOST is a machine. When I say "machine" it means some place where you
can go with a IP address or a name, and have ssh support.

A CLASS is a group of hosts.

We use XML-SSI technology. SSI stands for Server Side Includes, which is
very important when we say "Instant" Diagnose System. The SDI structure
has been developed to explore a little of server processing with some
includes, and then letting all jobs with user browser.


3. REQUIREMENTS
===============

To properly see sdi web pages you should have a web server running, and
this server must be configured to accept SSI (Server Side Includes) enabled.

On sdiweb the files types used with SSI are .shtml and .xml, so you must
configure the server to enable SSI on this mime types. A common problem with
this is that the server must respond the .xml file with a application/xml
Content-Type on page header.

We will show how to do a basic configuration when running Apache 2.


4. SDIWEB CONF VARIABLES
========================

These variables can be defined on sdi.conf file.

- WEBMODE (Boolean)
    If set to true, when launching sdi the first thing done for each class
    is generate all web files.

- SDIWEB
    The folder where sdiweb files are placed.

- WWWDIR
    The folder where the web final files will be placed.

- CLASSESDIR
    The folder where the classes files will be.

- CLASSNAME
    The classes name that will appear on top page bar select-box.

- HOSTCOLUMNNAME
    The header of column that holds the host name.

- DEFAULTCOLUMNS
    The default columns to be showed when first load a table.


5. CONFIGURING AND RUNNING SDI
==============================

These are the steps to configure and run SDI from the source. We presume
here that your web server are properly configured and running.

    1. Get to sdi.conf and alter CLASSESDIR and CLASSNAME like you want.
    2. Create CLASSESDIR folder.
    3. On this directory, create the files of each class.
       In a class file:
         - One host per line
         - The first column with separator " " will be consider the
         hostname.
    4. On sdi environment everything is configured, unless if you want to
       change any other folder.
    5. Now, we must secure that the SDIUSER have ssh access to each host
       without needing to type a password. This is important to security
       and stability of SDI.
         - If you don't have a ssh key, follow this commands:
            $ ssh-keygen -t dsa
            (follow the instructions and create a key without passphrase,
            I'll call the file created of $KEY)
            $ scp $KEY $SDIUSER@$HOST:~/
            $ ssh $SDIUSER@$HOST
            $ cat ~/$KEY >> ~/.ssh/authorized-keys
            $ logout
            $ ssh $SDIUSER@$HOST
            (on this ssh you access the HOST without a password)
         - The hosts setup is finish.
    6. Now, all is configured properly. go to SDI root folder and type:
            $ bash launchsdi.sh
       And SDI will be running on your server.
